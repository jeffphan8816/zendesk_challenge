Candidate name: Jeff Phan
Candidate email: jeffphan8816@gmail.com

- It's done for Zendesk Internship Coding Challenge using Zendesk TicketAPI (https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs).
- Due to the challenge has been occurring during my exams period, I did try my best to finish the fundamental requirements. I could improve it better if I have more time.
- I do not use model to store the tickets and I do not have much experience in testing JSON API, I could not implement so much for testing.
- What I have done:
  * Applied Zendesk API to retrieve Tickets
  * Applied MVC pattern using Ruby On Rails
  * Handled errors such as: users' input, Zendesk API availability, empty record,...
  * Test cases for routing and flash messages for errors.
